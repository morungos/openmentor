<p>
This is the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> web site
for OpenMentor.
</p>
<p>
The development environment for Open Mentor has now been completed,
by and large. It is based on Eclipse running under Java JDK 1.5.0. We
are also using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and 
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. For full 
details of how to install
the development environment, see:
<a href="buildenv.html">the build environment page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the development process, we will be running two separate
versions of Open Mentor, available through the links below. Feel free
to dip into these systems and try them out.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Development version - 
<a href="http://openmentor.comp.rgu.ac.uk/development/">http://openmentor.comp.rgu.ac.uk/development/</a></li>
<li>Stable version - 
<a href="http://openmentor.comp.rgu.ac.uk/stable/">http://openmentor.comp.rgu.ac.uk/stable/</a> (version 1.0a1)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The development version is updated on a daily basis, and is likely to 
contain a fair number of bugs. However, it does reflect current
development work, and issues will be signed off against this version
of the system.
