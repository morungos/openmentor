    <h2>A web friendly model.</h2>
    <p>
      This package aims to represent the model in a more integrated
      and helpful way.  Thus the model itself has no reference to the
      fact that it is persistent; hence the availability of eg a
      <code>saveAssigment(Assignment ass)</code> method in this
      package.  This package also incorporates what (in the language
      of Torque) are Peer methods; those like
      <code>getAssigments(String courseId)</code> which are concerned
      with <strong>all</strong> assignments of a particular sort,
      rather than one particular instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The package also aims to be web-friendly.  Typically this means
      having <code>String</code> arguments, simply because that is
      what is needed at the web level, alowing eg necessary
      conversions of an <code>id</code> to an <code>int</code> to be
      hidden here.
