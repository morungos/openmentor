      The teaching model underlying the system recognises that
      students need an explicit level of socio-emotive support as well
      as direct instruction.  It recommends tutors praise the student
      for their achievement.  Point out mistakes in a constructive
      manner and offer explicit direction for student improvement in a
      specific piece of work and for future assignments.  It is
      especially important that the feedback students receive from
      teaching staff provides both the subject specific guidance they
      require and the support they need for further
      development. Initial research showed (see Whitelock et al 2004)
      that there was convincing evidence of systematic connections
      between different types of tutor comments and level of
      attainment in assessment and this was the platform for the
      development of OpenMentor.

    <div class ="para">
      OpenMentor analyses the tutors comments and sifts them to see if
      the underlying teaching model applies.  In fact there are four
      major categories that capture the activities of teaching using
      this modus operandi; which are positive reactions, negative
      reactions, questions posed to the student and solutions to
      specific difficulties presented in the assignments.  These
      interactional categories illustrate the balance of
      socio-emotional comments that support the student. Best practice
      has revealed that this balance of comments maintains student
      motivation.  The tutor also can use a range of questions in a
      number of different ways, some to stimulate further reflection,
      but others to point out, in a nice way, that there are problems
      with part of an assignment.  <br/><br/> Open Mentor works by
      stripping out the tutor comments on an electronic assignment,
      applying a set of rules to these comments in order to put them
      into four major categories of Postive reactions, Teaching
      points, Questions and Negative reactions. It then provides
      feedback to the tutor about how their comments provide support
      to the tutor.  <br/><br/> <strong>Table 1: Bales' Interaction

    <h4>Evidence of praise and marks awarded - Group A comments </h4>
    <p>
      Peter White is a tutor on a science course.  He sent four
      student assignments to OpenMentor for analysis.  First of all he
      asked to see if he had given enough praise and positive comments
      to the students on these four assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/commentA_graph_1.jpg" 
           alt="Group A comments - example graph"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph indicated that on three of the four assignments Peter
      had not given enough praise for the mark awarded.  He was rather
      surprised at this finding since he had given these students high
      grades. He decided to give more positive comments to his more
      able students in the future.
    </p>	
    <p>
      Here are some types of positive comments that tutors use for
      positive responses:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        'Yes I agree they sound like Slatter's actions'
      </li>
      <li>
        'Good clear definition of this complex reaction'
      </li>
      <li>
        'Excellent'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="groupB"></a>
    <h4>Identify the percentage of teaching points of student
    improvement - Group B comments</h4>
    <p>	
      Adam Grey is a tutor on a business studies course.  He sent
      five student assignments to OpenMentor for analysis. He
      wanted to see if he had given enough teaching comments to
      the students on these five assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/commentB_graph_1.jpg" 
           alt="Group B comments - example graph"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      This graph illustrates that in the first assignment he gave more
      comments than expected for the mark awarded. However Iin the
      second he gave lesss than expected. The other three were about
      rightie there was a very little distance fom the zero line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of comments relating to teaching points by a business
      school tutor:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        'I was looking for ideas here e.g. discuss strategic issues
        (internal and external and then follow with some analysis of
        the external environment).'
      </li>
      <li>
        'In order to look at the long term suitability of the
        strategies a good starting point could be the strategic issues
        the company is facing'
      </li>
      <li>
        'It would have been appropriate here to have listed the main
        strategic issues facing the company'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="groupC"></a>
    <h4>The use of questioning as a teaching strategy - Group C
    comments</h4>
    <p>
      Karen Green is a tutor on an education course. She sent 13
      assignments to OpenMentor for analysis. After inspection of the
      types of comments she had made in groups A and B she requested
      an analysis of how she had used questioning as a strategy to
      assist her students. OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/commentC_graph_1.jpg" 
           alt="Group C comments - example graph"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph indicated that for three of the assignments Karen had
      used the expected amount of questioning for the mark
      awarded. Four assignments had rather more questions than
      expected while the rest had too few. This feedback made her
      think about this teaching strategy and to perhaps use it a
      little more frequently than he had done so in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of questions used by an education tutor
      marking some assignments:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        'Why did you elect to put a list like this in your main text
        rather than in your appendices? You would have saved hundreds
        of words by doing this and you would not have gone
        over-length'
      </li>
      <li>
        'So which of these factors are the ones that impact most upon
        classroom teaching?'
      </li>
      <li>
        'Why do you feel that this theory is of such importance?'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="groupD"></a>
        
    <h4>The propotion of negative feedback recorded - Group D
    comments</h4>
    <p>
      Mary Black is a tutor on an Arts course.  She sent five student
      assignments to OpenMentor for analysis. She asked to see if she
      had given too many negative comments comments to the students on
      these five assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/commentD_graph_1.jpg" 
           alt="Group D comments - example graph"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph illustrates the comments are few and below the zero
      line. This means she gave less than expected for the mark
      awarded in four out of five cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of negative feedback given by tutors on
      an arts course:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>'No this is not correct'</li>
      <li>'This description is not helpful and does not contribute to
      the argument'</li>
      <li>'No references'</li>
      <li>'This is not a genuine conclusion.'</li>

    <h4>Help train novice tutors</h4>
    <p>
      Here is an example scenario of how OpenMentor can be used to
      help train novice tutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gill White is a new tutor in the Health and Social Welfare
      Department.  Her college has sent her the guidelines for marking
      student assignments.  The document suggests a good way to
      motivate her students is to provide timely and constructive
      feedback.  There are four main areas to concentrate on when
      providing this feedback which are providing good positive
      reactions and praise where it is due to the student.  Being
      careful what the phrasing of negative reactions, posing
      questions to the student and offering solutions to specific
      difficulties presented in the assignments.  In this way a
      balance of socio-emotional comments with teaching comments can
      be used to support the student.  Practical illustrations of this
      mode of teaching and a means to try them out are offered by
      using an interactive computer tool OpenMentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gill logs on and is given a set of pre marked assignments to
      read and upload to OpenMentor.  She finds two are marked with
      not having enough praise or recognition of achievement for the
      mark awarded.  One has too much praise, two have too many
      questions, while one has a good balance of comments for the
      grade awarded.  Finally a script is presented that does not
      offer enough teaching comments that will help the student
      improve upon the mark given in this particular assignment.  The
      programme then encourages Gill to investigate the feedback on
      these example assignments.  She starts to build a picture of the
      student who, unlike the tutor, does not have access to the full
      range of marks of the cohort and is still unsure about how well
      they, as individuals, are performing with a high mark.  Students
      do need explicit praise if they have done well.  It is not all
      in the mark.  Questioning can be a good technique for pointing
      out omissions for example saying, 'Have you thought about
      including a particular research finding into this argument?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She is then given an assignment to mark herself and uploads to
      the system.  She decides to revise some of the feedback but is
      happy with grade she has given the student.  She prints off her
      feedback and will follow up this training session with her
      mentor at their next meeting.
    </p>
    <a name="scenario2"></a>
    <h4>Encourage best practice between a group of tutors supporting a
    course</h4>
    <p>
      A group of tutors reviewed all the TMAs by tutor for their
      course.  They noticed that an interesting teaching pattern was
      occurring with one of the tutors.  In fact it was the skilful
      use of questions to the students and direct teaching comments.
      This tutor was more likely to give fewer direct teaching
      comments per mark awarded.  He used fewer direct teaching
      comments than would be expected on some TMAs.  Further
      investigation revealed that this occurred after he had inserted
      more comments than would be expected on the previous TMA.  He
      also gave more praise on the following TMA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tutors thought this was an interesting teaching strategy and
      began to look for others in this group.  They wanted to explore
      and identify a number of strategies that could be used as
      examples for discussion at their next meeting.

    <h4>Provide professional development for individual tutors</h4>
    <p>
      Sue Brown is a tutor on a psychology course and has just
      finished marking her latest batch of 43 course assessments.  On
      the whole she feels that her students have done well.  Before
      passing them to a second marker, Sue sends them to OpenMentor
      and, in return, she gets a table which flags a few questions on
      about five of them.  Two are marked that she is giving fewer
      suggestions than would be expected for the low grade she has
      awarded, and three that she is asking for more information than
      would be expected for the high grade awarded.  She decides to
      revise her feedback in three cases and considers changing the
      grade in two others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred decides to review his marking of one particular student's
      set of assignments as he is concerned about this student's
      rather erratic progress and wants to see how he can improve upon
      his own commenting for the next assignment.  Jon is the name of
      this student and Fred's feedback on the three essays marked to
      date for Jon suggests Fred has given too few directed teaching
      comments on the first assignment, too many on the second and too
      few on the third.  Where his teaching comments were fewer than
      expected for the mark awarded, Fred actually asked more
      questions.  This seemed a strange balance to Fred, especially as
      the mark improved after this pattern of commenting.  He thought
      it should be the other way around, so in order to investigate
      further he then asked OpenMentor to pull down the range of
      questions he asked in these essays.  He found interestingly
      enough that when he asked the following types of questions:
      'Have you thought about including X in this account because it
      could bolster your argument about Y here?'  Fred was pointing
      out omissions in such a way that he was actually producing more
      helpful commenting.  This was due to Fred's particular teaching
      style and made him realize this was a good way to proceed.
      OpenMentor is able to point out Fred's particular teaching

    <h4>Support quality processes through use as a monitoring tool</h4>

      After Sue Brown has checked her marking in the OpenMentor system
      and makes a few changes to her assignments, she sends them to
      OpenMentor again and then forwards them, with the feedback
      table, to her course coordinator for monitoring.  Her course
      monitor, John Black, is able to use the feedback to focus more
      carefully on those assessments that seem to need most attention
      rather than (as she used to do) simply looking at the borderline
      cases.  This enables him to keep a better overview of the
      learners' progress than when he used to simply look at a bar
      chart of the grade distribution.
